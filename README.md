# qmp

A compact, pretty, and cross-platform music player.

# What is it üêµ

It is a music player that is:

- Inspired by [Ionica](https://ionica.app/) and [Winamp](https://winamp.com/)
- Minimalistic
- Customizable
- Cross-platform

# What it is <u>not</u> üôà

- A lightweight player (using electron guarantees a 300-500Mb binary size)
- A low-RAM player (once again because electron)
- An online/remote audio player

# Why make it ‚ùî

I liked the Ionica UI and features. Yet, it is MacOS only, has features I do not need, and requires paying for the full feature set. So I wanted to make something just as simple & minimalistic but at the same time cross-platform, fully free, and customizable to my liking.

# Development Status üö•

Status: In progress (see feature roadmap below)\
Progress: Minimal set of features is done - app is more or less usable

### Will not implement & reasoning

- Play tracks from anywhere other than a local drive
  - Too much pain + I will not use these features myself
- Full screen mode
  - Too much empty space, does not feel like Winamp or Ionica
- Video playback
  - This is not meant to be a media player
- Anything that would make the UI cluttered / unintuitive
  - Self-explanatory
